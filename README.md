PennCoursePlus 

Beta version

Displays Average Course difficulty, quality when browsing on PennInTouch
The professor rating is based upon their quality ratings within the department 
(not all the courses)

May run slowly, depending on internet speed. Could try reloading page

Note some professors may not have rating- either they are new
there are irregularities in middle initial, so difficult to search for them. 
Will try to fix that in the future

This is not a substitute for PCR, but a nice addition to enhance your course 
selection process.
